drive_cleanup.py

replace the content of the 'src' variable with the directory you would like to begin the archive from.

You can add folders for the archiving to ignore, by adding their names in the 'exceptions' set. (ensure the archive variable is in this set, as otherwise
your new archive folder will be deleted)

the first number in the 'SECONDS' variable is the number of days since the time you want to archive from

You can also name the archive folder whatever you like by changing the value of the 'archive' variable
